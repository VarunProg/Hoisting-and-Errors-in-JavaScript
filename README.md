# Hoisting in-JavaScript
# what is Hoisting in JavaScript?
We can access functions and variables even before initilization in JavaScript just because of Hoisting. Hoisting as a core concept relies on the way how Execution Context is created.

# Hoisting in the case of function and var declaration
Here is the example\
//accessing variable before initializing\
console.log(b); \
//calling function even  before declaring it\
a(); \
var b = 10; \
function a() { \
    console.log("a funcion");\
}
 \
 output\
 undefined\
 a function 
 # so what happens behind the scenes
 Hoisting as a core concept relies on the way how Execution Context is created.\
 So first let's understand what is execution context and how it's created to understand better hoisting concept.\
 There are 2 types of execution context global and local, global is created when JS program is run and Local exeution context is created when function is invoked(call).\
 first Javascript engine loads the JS file and parses the code then it enters into Global Execution Context that is the default execution context where JavaScript engine enters first.\
 Whenever JS program is run a global object is created, global execution context is created along with that execution context and this keyword is created. Global obejct is created even before JS engine enters to the GEC(Global Execution Context) and what Global object contains it contains eventHandlers, history,ScrollX,Window object(in the case of browser), localStorage and more..
 
Now let's understand How code is executed?\
Global Execution Context is created and it is pushed into the callstack, Global Execution Context is like a big container where all code is executed it has 2 phases.\
1- Memory creation phase\
2- Code Execution phase

In **Memory creation phase** memoery is allocated to global variables and global functions even before single of code is executed, in the case of variables memory is assigned undefined and in the case of functions the exact copy of function. **that is why this is the reason in the case of var declaration it gives us Undefined when we try to access variable even before initialization** so this is the first phase done in Global Execution Context.\
\
In **Code Execution phase** value is assigned to variables and functions. As JS engine reaches to function invocation it creates a new execution context, it has again 2 phases Memory creation phase or Code Execution phase and in this phase again same thing happpens memory is assigned to variables and functions first then value is assigned to the functions and variables in Code Execution phase.

# Hoisting in the case of let and const declaration
when we try to access variables declaration with let and const even before initialization it gives errors.\
// let declaration and const declaration \
console.log(c);\
let c = 10;

output: **ReferenceError: Cannot access 'c' before initialization** \
So are let and const declration are Hoisted? \
yes, they are hoisted too.\
\
if we declare variable with var declaration we get undefined and with let declaration we are getting an error but this error message says something Cannot access 'c' before initialization.\
so why this happened?\
in the case of let and const we get reference error if we try to access them before initialization but message says that memory is assigned but can not access it before intilization means JS engine knows about the variable but it is not allowing to use it before intilization.\
if memory is not initilized then we should get error with message **ReferenceError: c is not defined**\
because what js interpretrs does it splits the variables and functions declaration into 2 parts\
1- it assigns the memory to the global variables and functions even before single line of code is execute\
2- it executes the code and assigned the values to variables and functions.

# functional Hoisting
function declarations are hoisted too, function hoisting allows us to call before it is declared or defined.
 **in the case of function declaration we can acces function even before initilizing it.**\
//accessing variable before initializing\
console.log(b);\
//calling function even before declaring it\
a();\
console.log(b);\
var b = 10;\
function a() {\
console.log("a funcion");
}\
output:\
a function, undefined
# what is the difference between function expression and function declaration?
the only difference between two is hoisting.

first let's understand what is Function declaration and function statement and function expression.\
**Function declaration and function statement**
a();
function a() {\
console.log("a funcion");\
}\
this is the simple example example of function statement and function declaration\
**function expression**
 var c = function () {\
 console.log("function called");\
 };\
 
 # so what's the difference between function expression and function declaration
 in the case of function declaration we can access function even before initilizing it but in function expression if we try to access function before intilizing it we get type error.\
 **example of function declaration**\
 a();
function a() {\
console.log("a funcion");\
}\
output: here we are able to access function a before initilizing it because during memory creation phase memory is assigned to the function a the whole copy of it.
 
**example of function expression**\
 c();\
 var c = function () {\
 console.log("function called");\
 };\
 output:\
 TypeError: c is not a function\
 \
 why this happened, just because of hositing.\
 in case of function  expression  during memory creation phase memory is assigned to the variable c is undefined and in code execution phase this whole copy of function 
 is assigned to the variable c untill then it is undefined so here the value of variable c is unfined and we can not call it.
